This is a dumb game. 

How to play:

1) The deck of cards are split evenly amongst the players
2) The main goal is to place down all cards in a player's hand
3) To place a card, it must be placed into an established suit (spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds) and be the next number in the established stack
EX: you can play a 4 of hearts OR a 9 of hearts on an established heart stack consisting of 8, 7, 6, 5 cards. you CANNOT place any card lower than a 4 or higher than a 9 just yet. 
4) To establish a new suit, the 7 of that suit is placed (to establish clubs, the 7 of clubs must be the first club card put down)
5) If a player does not have any cards they can play, they must fold a card of their choosing. Whatever number is on the folded card is added to the player's score (EX: King is 13 points, 9 is 9 points, Ace is 1 point). Whoever has the smallest score at the end of the game wins!
6) A player cannot fold a card if they have a playable card. By default, all 7's are playable cards
7) To start, the 7 of spades is the first card placed
